# Groupme Chatbot

## Introduction

Groupme recently released a chatbot called 'Zo', and it isn't very useful. I've decided to make my own with a fresh and creative name.

## Accepted Queries

You can interact with Bo with his trigger phrase, `@Bo`.

[[Coming soon]]

## Deployment

Bo is deployed to Heroku [here,](https://groupme-ratbot.herokuapp.com/) but to really interact you'd have to be in a GroupMe chat with me!
